```

# Introduction

The phsstyles package should make it easy to use the official PHS colour scheme
in an accessible way in R plots. 

Several examples are presented here, all using the 
Toenail cancer Quality Performance Indicators dataset, 
ie dummy tabular data produced for this tutorial. 

## Population Pyramid


```{r population_pyramid}
# Import dummy data
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r regional_network_bar_chart, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
